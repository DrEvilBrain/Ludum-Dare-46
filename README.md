KeepAlive

Created for the Ludum Dare 43.

cart.tic is a cartridge you can open in any distribution of TIC-80.
keepalive.tic is a standalone executable you can play without having to install TIC-80.
keepalive.lua is the game's source code, but it's weirdly formatted because I wrote it all in TIC-80's native text editor. Probably won't do that ever again.
