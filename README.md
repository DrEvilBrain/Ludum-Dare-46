KeepAlive

Created for the Ludum Dare 43.

`keepalive.tic` is a standalone executable you can play without having to install TIC-80.

`cart.tic` is a cartridge you can open in any distribution of TIC-80 that is at least on v80.

`keepalive706.tic` is a cartridge you can open in v70.6 of TIC-80. This is because v80 adds new music effects that won't import properly onto v70.6.

`keepalive.lua` is the game's source code, but it's weirdly formatted because I wrote it all in TIC-80's native text editor. Probably won't do that ever again.
